//! The timezone a scan buckets usage into.
//!
//! Which local calendar day a unit of usage lands in used to be a function of
//! the machine's timezone *at scan time*: every date string was derived from
//! `chrono::Local`, read afresh on every run. Rescanning the same history from
//! another zone therefore re-split it across days, and the server's monotonic
//! per-day guard kept the stale value on one day while accepting the new one on
//! its neighbour — inflating the total permanently, with no way to walk it back.
//!
//! The bucket key has to come from a value the machine cannot silently change
//! underneath a rescan. So the CLI records the zone once and reuses it.
//!
//! # Why a named IANA zone and not a fixed offset
//!
//! A `chrono::FixedOffset` would need no new dependency, but it does not follow
//! DST. Pin `UTC+09:00` in a zone that observes DST and the pinned offset stops
//! matching local midnight the moment the transition happens, so usage within an
//! hour of the boundary lands on the wrong day — a bounded re-run of the very
//! bug being removed here. A named zone carries the transition rules, so local
//! midnight stays local midnight and the fix is exact rather than approximate.
//!
//! # Unpinned is not "pinned to Local"
//!
//! [`BucketTimezone::Local`] exists so that a device which has never pinned
//! keeps today's semantics *exactly*. Callers are expected to skip the rebucket
//! pass entirely when [`BucketTimezone::is_pinned`] is false rather than
//! re-derive dates through `Local`, so an unpinned scan does not depend on this
//! module being byte-identical to what the parsers already computed.

/// in older ones, and `rebucket_days` applies an accepted pin to *every*

/// lower bound on any instant the rebucket passes will move — to ten years
/// ahead. Nothing auto-pinning can re-key falls outside it.

/// # What the wider window costs
///
/// It rejects more. Two zones that share today's rules but split in the 1970s
/// or 1980s no longer pass — `America/New_York` and `America/Toronto` diverged
/// over the 1974-75 US emergency DST, `Asia/Seoul` and `Asia/Tokyo` over
/// Seoul's 1987-88 DST — and if the host's zoneinfo and the bundled `chrono-tz`
/// database ever disagree on an old rule for the *same* zone name, this
/// declines to pin at all.
///
/// That is the safe direction to be wrong in. Declining leaves the device
/// exactly where it was: bucketing by `chrono::Local`, carrying a bug it
/// already had. Accepting wrongly rewrites history that is already on the
/// server, behind a monotonic guard that makes the result permanent.
///
/// # Why sampling at 30 minutes is enough inside the window
///
/// The step has to be smaller than the shortest interval over which two
/// plausible zones can disagree. DST offsets move in whole or half hours, and
