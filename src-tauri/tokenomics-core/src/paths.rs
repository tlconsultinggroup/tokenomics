//! Cross-platform resolution for tokenomics's user config and cache dirs.
//!
//! Tokenomics-core needs the same path helpers tokenomics-cli uses (settings
//! and message/pricing caches read from related directories), so the
//! resolver lives here and is re-exported from tokenomics-cli for callers
//! that already imported it from there. macOS users following the docs
//! expect `~/.config/tokenomics/` because that is what `auth.rs`,
//! `cursor.rs`, and `antigravity.rs` already write to.
//! `dirs::config_dir()` would instead return `~/Library/Application Support/`
//! on macOS, splitting state across two roots and silently ignoring
//! settings.json edits the user made via the documented path. This module
//! enforces the unified `~/.config/tokenomics/` location on macOS + Linux,
//! while keeping the platform default on Windows.

/// Resolve the user's home directory, honoring `$HOME` on every platform.
///
/// `dirs::home_dir()` reads `$HOME` on Unix but goes straight to the Win32
/// known-folder API on Windows, where no environment variable can redirect
/// it. The asymmetry is invisible until something actually runs on Windows:
/// a caller that points `HOME` at a scratch directory is obeyed on Unix and
/// silently ignored on Windows, so it keeps reading — and writing — the real
/// profile. That is exactly what #997 found once a Windows runner existed;
/// `test_ensure_config_dir` was creating `%USERPROFILE%\.config\tokenomics` on
/// the machine running the suite, and `test_load_credentials_nonexistent`
/// was asserting against the developer's own credentials file.
///
/// `$HOME` is only honored on Windows when it is an absolute native path
/// (`C:\...`, `\\?\C:\...`, `\\server\share`). Two shapes are rejected, both
/// because `Path` silently resolves them against ambient state:
///
/// - POSIX-shaped values such as `/home/user`, exported by MSYS2, Cygwin and
///   Git Bash. `Path` reads the leading `/` as "root of the current drive",
///   so obeying them would relocate the config of every user who launches
///   tokenomics from a Unix-shell emulator to `C:\home\user`.
/// - Drive-relative values such as `C:temp`, which carry a `Prefix` but no
///   root. Windows resolves those against the *per-drive current directory*,
///   so the same `HOME` names a different place depending on where the
///   process last `cd`-ed on drive C — home-rooted reads and writes would
///   land somewhere unintended and unreproducible.
///
/// `Path::is_absolute` on Windows is exactly `has_root() && prefix().is_some()`,
/// which rejects both in one check while leaving the redirect available to
/// anything that can set a real native path.
///
/// Every home-rooted path in the workspace must resolve through here rather
/// than calling `dirs::home_dir()` directly, otherwise the redirect holds for
/// some roots and not others and the two disagree about where state lives.
